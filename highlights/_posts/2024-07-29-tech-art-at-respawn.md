### Project Overview

As a technical art intern, I worked with the Respawn External Development team, focusing on two major titles: *Apex Legends* and the *Star Wars* franchise. My primary tasks included conducting a performance analysis on *Apex Legends* and building an asset library for *Star Wars*. My manager and I aimed to familiarize myself with various technologies, understand different game genres, and prepare a presentation for EA leadership at the end of my internship.

### Performance Analysis of *Apex Legends*

I analyzed cosmetic performance which includes both character and weapon skins in *Apex Legends* using RenderDoc.

### Developing the StarWars Asset Library

With the performance analysis complete, I shifted focus to developing an Unreal build for browsing *Star Wars* assets. Collaborating with my technical art director, I designed data schemes that work with EA's shared assets library and brainstormed a UI/UX flow that a shopping-like experience. While learning Unreal Blueprint from scratch, I built out the fundamental features such as shop cart, props inspection mode, export cart to EA, and teleport-to-props functionality.

### Documentation and Presentation Preparation

Given the importance of documentation, I organized my code and provided extensive comments to facilitate future developers' understanding. I also prepared for my final presentation, leveraging feedback from my team to create a clear narrative showcasing my contributions.

### Conclusion

Reflecting on my time at Respawn Entertainment, I feel a deep sense of accomplishment. From performance analysis to tool development, I expanded my technical abilities and learned the significance of effective communication.I am grateful for the mentorship and support I received throughout this journey.
