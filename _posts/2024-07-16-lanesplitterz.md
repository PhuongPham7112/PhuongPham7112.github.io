First time trying out a project that's very stylized.

### Toon Shading
Made a toon outline & shading post-processing effect using Sobel edge detection algorithm based on normal, depth, and color. 
Also added a bit of a custom Bloom effect inspired by Benday Dots with Scriptable Render Pipeline.

### Smoke VFX
More stylized smoke effects compared to my previous projects. It looks really cool with the toon effects!
