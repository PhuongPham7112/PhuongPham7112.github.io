### Intro
Lanesplitterz was my first time trying out a project that's very stylized. Since my art team wanted a flatter cartoon-ish look, I made a toon outline & shading post-processing effect using Sobel edge detection algorithm based on normal, depth, and color. With some cel-shading on top and a LOT of tuning, we had a pretty cool effect that feels like a comic book.
