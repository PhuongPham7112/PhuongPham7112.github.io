### Intro
First time trying out a project that's very stylized.

### Implementation
#### Toon Shading
Since my art team wanted a flatter cartoon-ish look, I made a toon outline & shading post-processing effect using Sobel edge detection algorithm based on normal, depth, and color. With some cel-shading on top and a LOT of tuning, we had a pretty cool effect that feels like a comic book.

#### VFX
More stylized effects compared to my previous projects. It looks really cool with the toon post-processing look!
