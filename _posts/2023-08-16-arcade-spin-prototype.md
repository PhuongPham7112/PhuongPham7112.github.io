🎮 DizzyDots is a small arcade game prototype I made last year, not exactly complete in the future, but I like to experiment with the concept of a trippy experience with changing environment. Your goal as the player is very simple: collect all the green dots while avoiding the red dots, with the stage spinning around you.\
🕹️ Control: A = left, D = right, space = jump
