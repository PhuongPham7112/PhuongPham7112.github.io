This project is a GPU-driven ocean simulation that combines **FFT wave generation**, **interactive ripples via iWave**, and **GPU buoyancy**. The goal was to move beyond simple Gerstner waves and build a scalable, realistic, yet interactive ocean surface suitable for games.

## FFT Waves

My first attempt at ocean simulation was with **Gerstner waves** for a student game (*DuoQ*). While functional, the results ended up looking pretty simplistic and cartoonish. I wanted more realism and extensibility.

Inspired by [*The Technical Art of Sea of Thieves*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9BOz2dFZzs), I explored using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) waves. The core idea is to generate wave information in the **frequency (spectrum) domain** and transform it into the **spatial domain** using the [Inverse FFT (Cooley–Tukey algorithm)](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1965-19-090/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1.pdf).

I used the [Phillips spectrum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03945) to define the statistical distribution of wave heights given various parameters such as gravity, wind direction, choppiness, and amplitude. From this, I generated two key textures that will later go through iFFT compute shaders to extract spatial information:

* **Displacement Map** – encodes vertical and horizontal wave displacement.
* **Normal Map** – encodes surface orientation for light shading.

For further visual realism, I implemented foam generation by running a Jacobian test on the displacement map that could identify regions where waves fold or intersect - here, foam buildup would naturally happen. This produced breaking wave crests and dynamic foam patterns.

```c++
// https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~jtessen/reports/papers_files/coursenotes2004.pdf
float jxx = 1 + lambda * dx_dx;
float jyy = 1 + lambda * dy_dy;
float jxy = lambda * dx_dy;
float jyx = lambda * dy_dx;
float negativeJ = 0.5f * (jxx + jyy) - 0.5f * sqrt((jxx - jyy) * (jxx - jyy) + 4.0f * jxy * jxy);
float foam = saturate(1.0f - negativeJ);
foam = smoothstep(0.3f, 1.0f, foam); // Smooth the transition for foam effect
```

## Interactive Ripples (iWave)

To make the ocean reactive to objects, I integrated the [iWave algorithm](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~jtessen/reports/papers_files/Interactive_Water_Surfaces.pdf) for local water interactions.

I placed a camera above the ocean plane that captures silhouettes of objects intersecting or hovering above the water. This data is written into a **render texture**, which serves as the input to the iWave simulation.

The iWave algorithm applies a **convolution kernel** to simulate ripple propagation outward from disturbance sources. The resulting **ripple texture** is sampled in the shader and blended with the FFT surface normals, allowing characters, boats, or other objects to leave trails and ripples in the water.

```c++
// iWave set up - the key part
m_convolutionKernel = new float[(2 * m_kernelSize + 1) * (2 * m_kernelSize + 1)];

float g0 = 0.0f;
for (int n = 0; n < m_iterations; n++)
{
	float qn = m_deltaQ * n;
	g0 += qn * qn * Mathf.Exp(-m_sigma * qn * qn);
}

for (int k = -m_kernelSize; k <= m_kernelSize; k++)
{
	for (int l = -m_kernelSize; l <= m_kernelSize; l++)
	{
		// idx = x * size + y
		float r = Mathf.Sqrt((float)(k * k + l * l));
		float val = 0.0f;
		for (int n = 0; n < m_iterations; n++)
		{
			float qn = m_deltaQ * n;
			val += qn * qn * Mathf.Exp(-m_sigma * qn * qn) * (float)j0(qn * r);
		}
		SetKernelValue(k, l, val / g0);
	}
}
```

## GPU Buoyancy

Objects floating on the water surface are displaced directly on GPU using the **FFT displacement map**. This ensures that buoyant objects ride the same waves visible in the rendering, keeping the physics and visuals in sync without extra CPU-side calculations.

```c++
// vertex shader
void vert (inout appdata_full v)
{
	UNITY_SETUP_INSTANCE_ID(v); // Setup instance ID

	float4 center = mul(unity_ObjectToWorld, float4(0, 0, 0, 1));
	float buoyancyStrength = UNITY_ACCESS_INSTANCED_PROP(Props, _BuoyancyStrength);
	float2 uv = center.xz / _MeshSize;
	uv += 0.5f;
	float3 disp = tex2Dlod(_DisplacementTex, float4(uv, 0, 0)).xyz;
	v.vertex.xyz += disp * buoyancyStrength;
}
```

## Rendering

The shading model is built on a **Phong lighting model** enhanced with a **Fresnel term**. The Fresnel effect blends between diffuse ocean color and reflected sky color, giving the water its characteristic reflective look.

Normals are combined from two sources:

1. **FFT normals** for large-scale ocean motion.
2. **iWave ripple normals** for fine local interactions.

Foam textures are blended on top, guided by the Jacobian test results and displacement intensity. This produces convincing shoreline foam and cresting waves.

A core section of the shader blends the FFT normals with iWave ripple normals before applying lighting:

```c++
// sample ripple texture (convert world pos to UV)
float2 uv = i.worldVertex.xz / _MeshSize + 0.5f;

float hL = tex2D(_RippleTex, uv + float2(-texel.x, 0)).r;
float hR = tex2D(_RippleTex, uv + float2(texel.x, 0)).r;
float hD = tex2D(_RippleTex, uv + float2(0, -texel.y)).r;
float hU = tex2D(_RippleTex, uv + float2(0, texel.y)).r;

// compute ripple normals
float dx = (hDL + 2.0 * hL + hUL) - (hDR + 2.0 * hR + hUR);
float dy = (hDL + 2.0 * hD + hDR) - (hUL + 2.0 * hU + hUR);
float3 n1 = normalize(float3(dx, dy, 1.0f / _NormalStrength));

// combine with FFT normal
float3 n2 = tex2D(_NormalTex, i.uv).rgb * 2.0f - 1.0f;
float3 r = normalize(float3(n1.xy + n2.xy, n1.z * n2.z));

// final world normal
float3 worldNormal = UnityObjectToWorldNormal(r);

// Fresnel + foam shading
float reflectivity = pow(1.0f - saturate(dot(viewDirection, worldNormal)), _FresnelPower);
_DiffuseColor = lerp(_SkyColor, _DiffuseColor, reflectivity);

float foam = tex2D(_FoamTex, i.uv).r;
```

This combination of FFT, iWave, Fresnel, and foam creates a water surface that’s not just realistic but also **interactive and dynamic**.
