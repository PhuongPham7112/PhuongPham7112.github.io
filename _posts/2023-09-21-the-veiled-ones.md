## Something very cool under construction!
I'm currently working on a horror game with fellow USC students as a technical artist, which is my first time partaking in a game project under this role. Below is some stuff I've been working on:

### Magic Looking Glass
One of the game's main mechanism is player looking through a magical looking glass that helps them see and interact with hidden objects from the ghostly world of Jinn. My first task as a technical artist is to create that enchanting feeling of the glass. I created a volume profile for the night-vision-esque effect of the ghost world and worked on a scrolling-texture effect for glass material.
