## Something very cool under construction!
I'm currently working on a horror game with fellow USC students as a technical artist, which is my first time partaking in a game project under this role. Below is some stuff I've been working on:

### Magic Looking Glass
One of the game's main mechanism is player looking through a magical looking glass that helps them see and interact with hidden objects from the ghostly world of Jinn. My first task as a technical artist is to create that enchanting feeling of the glass. I created a volume profile for the night-vision-esque effect of the ghost world and worked on a scrolling-texture effect for glass material.

### Jinn's Ghost Effect
The ghostly entity **Jinn** will always be in the player's presence, but depending on whether the player looks through the looking glass, Jinn will have different visual effects. I'm working on an interactive smoke that will emit from Jinn in the normal human world. Still in working progress :)
