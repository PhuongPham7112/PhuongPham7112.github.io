This was my first project in OpenGL where I learned about the pipeline and worked with vertex shader to recreate three-dimensional representations of 2D images in three different view modes: point, wireframe, and smooth. It was challenging to get the hang of OpenGL's workflow (i.e. uploading points and colors to the VBO for GPU access), but the results were very rewarding.
