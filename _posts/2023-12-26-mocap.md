I coded up a nifty little program that reads in AMC files with given skipped frame and allows user to interpolate between the frames with four modes:

1. Linear interpolation for Euler angles
2. Bezier interpolation for Euler angles
3. Linear interpolation for Quaternions
4. Bezier interpolation for Quaternions

I had a blast coding this up. Dealing with Euler angles and Quaternions can be a mind-bender, but seeing those smooth transitions makes it all worth it. Plus, I learned a ton about the nuances of different interpolation methods and their effects on 3D animations.

# Demo

Below are some results where the original motion is in red and the interpolated result is in green.
