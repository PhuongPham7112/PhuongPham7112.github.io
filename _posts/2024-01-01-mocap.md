I programmed a project that reads in AMC files with given skipped frame and allows user to interpolate between the frames with four modes:
1. Linear interpolation for Euler angles
2. Bezier interpolation for Euler angles
3. Linear interpolation for Quaternions
4. Bezier interpolation for Quaternions

Below are some results where the original motion is in red and the interpolated result is in green.
