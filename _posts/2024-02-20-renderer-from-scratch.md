Over the winter break, I made a software rasterizer with C++. The project helped me a lot with understanding the rendering pipeline and the math behind OpenGL. [Source code](https://github.com/PhuongPham7112/rasterizer-from-scratch).

### Rendered images
- Gourald shaders: diffuse + specular + ambient
- Normal mapping
- Glow mapping
- Shadow mapping
- Gamma correction
