### Intro
A little mobile rhythm-based game with a Tarot theme üîÆ, inspired by my childhood games like Cytus and Aumobile. You can pull the project and play [here](https://github.com/PhuongPhamUSC/Tarot-Tempo). 

I had a lot of fun making notes pattern, breaking down my observations from other rhythm games, and built a small system to support different motions like tapping or swiping. The 3D third-person camera implementation was also from scratch as well, which involved 3D math + polar coordinates. 

Like any other games, you know I had to make some shaders for that *juice*, featuring a swirling portal door, a weird milky wave floor, and ghost-like fresnel characters, all made with Unity Shader Graph. Whipped out my Ipad after decades to draw the little stars and koi fish textures for my bubbles.
