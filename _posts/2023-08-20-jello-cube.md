I attempted to recreate a jiggly jello cube's physics from CSCI 520. It's a fun challenge with mass spring systems where one has to balance a cube's original structure with spring and external forces. Here are some *bouncy* animations to look at.

Extra fancy stuff:
- Textured cube with hand-drawn texture image (JJK reference)
- Inclined plane collision logic & render
- Customized lighting and material
- Optimized conversion from float to int and avoid float division in external force interpolation
- Interactivity with the cube (drag left mouse anywhere on the screen and the force will apply to the cube)
