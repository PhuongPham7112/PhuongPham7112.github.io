One of the things I thought I would never cross from my bucket list is building a PC. 

## Using PC Part Pickers

Before starting my build, I used PC Part Picker to research and select compatible components. The tool helped me avoid compatibility issues and compare prices across different retailers. It was especially useful for checking if the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and case would all work together. My part list can be found [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/AiriPham/saved/#view=pbmJt6)

## Steps I Went Through to Assemble the Computer

As a total newbie, I followed [Linus Tech Tips PC Build Guide (2024)](https://youtu.be/s1fxZ-VWs2U?si=JdHXQ1XORkeeWzov)

1. **Installed the CPU and RAM on the motherboard**: This step was easier on a flat surface before placing the motherboard in the case.
2. ****
3. **Mounted the motherboard in the case**: Carefully aligned it with the standoffs and secured it.
4. **Installed the power supply**: Routed the cables for easier management later.
5. **Added storage drives and GPU**: Connected SSDs/HDDs and slotted in the graphics card.
6. **Connected all cables**: Double-checked connections for power, data, and front panel buttons.
7. **First boot and BIOS setup**: Powered on the system and configured BIOS settings before installing the operating system.

## Post-Build Experience

I used my build to do personal graphics programming stuff, playing games, and coding projects. Going smooth so far, will need to do stress testing. All parts came exactly as expected and I did not need to buy extra things to assemble the components. I used Linus Tech Tips 2024 Build Guide, which was helpful but not exactly the best way to assemble my specific build. I would definitely try to put the motherboard inside the case after putting in the CPU, because the gigantic cooler and graphics card made it almost impossible to connect the front panel wires to the pins.
