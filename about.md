## Who I am
Hey there, I'm Phuong Pham, but I normally go by Airi.

Coming from a Computer Science degree with an emphasis on Games Development, I was really able to study the foundational skills of both a developer and a designer. I'm really interested in learning and creating graphics work that can enable story-telling or mechanism in game development.Always found myself to gravitate towards art & tech intersection regardless of the GE classes that I have to go through.

My biggest hobby is learning, and my second one is solving puzzle games. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading philosophy and classical novels, learning fashion history on the side, and drawing things/people/memories I love. 

Feel free to reach out to discuss whatever swe, games, or graphics stuff with me:)
