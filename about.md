Hey there, I'm Phuong Pham, but I normally go by Airi. Coming from a Computer Science degree with an emphasis on Games Development, I was really able to study the foundational skills of both a developer and a designer. Most of my work experience is full-stack software development, but I also have learned a range of interesting topics such as game development, computer systems, ML/AI, and graphic programming, with the latter two being my recent emphasis lately. My biggest hobby is learning, and my second one is solving puzzle games. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading philosophy and classical novels, learning fashion history on the side, and drawing things/people/memories I love. 

Feel free to reach out to discuss whatever swe, games, or graphics stuff with me:)
