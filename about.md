## 💭 Who I am
I’m Phuong Pham, but I normally go by Airi. I'm a Computer Science BS and MS graduate from University of Southern California.

Coming from a Computer Science background with an emphasis on Game Development, I was really able to study the foundational skills of both a developer and a designer. I’m interested in learning and creating graphics work that can enable story-telling or mechanisms in game development. I have always found myself gravitating towards the intersection of art & tech regardless of the GE classes that I have to go through.

I've done visual effects, physics simulation, shaders, tools scripting, and performance optimization for personal and team projects. Open to any challenges in the graphics space:)

My biggest hobby is learning, and my second one is solving puzzle games. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading philosophy and classical novels, learning fashion history on the side, and drawing things/people/memories I love. 

Feel free to reach out to discuss whatever swe, games, or graphics stuff with me:)

## 🛠️ My skillset
I have experience on both art and technical sides, leaning towards the latter more.
- Languages: C#, C++, Python, Java, Javascript
- Game Engine: Unreal, Unity
- Graphics API: OpenGL, DirectX11
- 3D Software: Maya, Houdini
