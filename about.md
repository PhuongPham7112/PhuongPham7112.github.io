## üí≠ Who I am
Hey there, I‚Äôm Phuong Pham, but I normally go by Airi.

Coming from a Computer Science degree with an emphasis on Games Development, I was really able to study the foundational skills of both a developer and a designer. I‚Äôm interested in learning and creating graphics work that can enable story-telling or mechanisms in game development. Always found myself gravitating towards the art & tech intersection regardless of the GE classes that I have to go through.

I've done visual effects, physics simulation, shaders, tools scripting, and performance optimization for personal and team projects. Open to any challenges in the graphics space:)

My biggest hobby is learning, and my second one is solving puzzle games. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading philosophy and classical novels, learning fashion history on the side, and drawing things/people/memories I love. 

Feel free to reach out to discuss whatever swe, games, or graphics stuff with me:)
